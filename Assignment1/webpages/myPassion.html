Cricket is the most famous sports in India and that's the first sport I watched, played, read and listened. 
But, I was and am not a regular player. I just played street cricket when I was young.
</p><p>
I did my final years of schooling  (from year VIII to year XII) in a residential ashram where cricket was banned 
(Even the management was not sure about the reason). Football was the sports played over there. That's where I got 
acquainted with football. I learned about football and how to play the game. When I was surfing through youtube, 
I came across the video of famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_UEFA_Champions_League_Final" target="_blank"> Istanbul final</a>.
 Liverpool went 3 down to AC Milan before the half time. But in the second half, Liverpool bounced back to 3-3 (refer to the image on the left) and 
 lifted the prestigious trophy by winning through penalties. I was stunned especially by the captain Steven Gerrard. That's the match that motivated me to become a fan of Liverpool. 
 After that, I started watching a lot of football matches and I started to study football tactics and the history of famous players.
</p>
<p>
Generally, during Australia's time, the matches happen between 11 pm and 6 am. 
I stayed awake a lot of days to watch football matches. I wish I learned about football when I was 7 or 8 years old. I could have been playing the game by now professionally. 
I wish, maybe someday, I'll watch a football match at Anfield stadium (Liverpool home ground). 
I didn't still write a blog about football because I feel I still have to learn a lot about the sport.
